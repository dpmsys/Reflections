When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    As a backup to your local repository
    To work from multiple computers
    To work with others on a project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Others may push updates to the remote if you are working with collaborators.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

   Forks are copies of another repository stored on GITHUB and allow you to make a working copy of a respository you 
   can not update

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Allows for automatic merge of some changes similar to comparing the baseline from beginning merging branches.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When you are experimenting with a concept that you may not implement on the master you might work in a branch
    When you are working on a new feature separate from other collaborators.
    You might implement immediate fixes to the master rather than a branch.
